# Clear localStorage

Got tired of viewed products on Jumia.com following me on the web. A way to deal with this is to clear your localStorage.
Clearing localStorage on chrome desktop is super easy and fast, mobile on the other hand, is quite a challenge.
Googled solutions to help with this problem, got some responses, but nothing actually works.
Knowing how eaasy it is to clear localStorage on a desktop, I thought why not build a simple web app to help resolve this.
Hence, this little application.

 - click Show Content, to get the list of keys in your localStorage.
 - click Clear Content, to clear all stored keys in your localStorage.
